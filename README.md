## Lloyd's Algorithm for Voronoi Diagrams
Lloyd's algorithm refines Voronoi diagrams by iteratively adjusting seed points for improved uniformity. It involves initializing seed points, constructing the initial diagram, recalculating centroids, updating seed points, and iterating until convergence. Benefits include improved diagram uniformity and wide applicability in various fields like computer graphics and spatial analysis. Convergence to local optima and parameter tuning are considerations. Lloyd's algorithm is widely used for spatial partitioning and optimization.
